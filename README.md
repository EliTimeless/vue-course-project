Vue Potter Project

A frontend project built with Vue 3 that displays characters, houses, and spells from the Harry Potter universe using the Potterhead API.

🌟 Project Description

The project showcases various elements from the Harry Potter world, including:

Characters with their details (name, house, blood status, etc.)

Spells used in the series

Movies with their details

Users can add their own custom characters

All data is fetched from the Potterhead API using Fetch, and user-added characters are displayed alongside the original ones. The interface is modern, responsive, and styled with Tailwind CSS. Navigation between pages is implemented using Vue Router with RouterLink.
